Consider now the evolution of the disease outbreak in a population in which a random fraction $p_{immune}$ of individuals has been vaccinated,
which makes them immune to the disease, i.e. they are already in state $R$ at time $t = 0$. 
We start again with a localized infection of a single individual at $(50,50)$ in a system of size $L = 100.$ 
For 100 realizations determine the time $t_{exit}$ as a function of $p_{immune} \in [0,0.4]$ and the number $N_D$ of individuals dying in the disease outbreak
(i.e. $N_D = N_R(t_exit) - N_R(0)$). 
This program plots the mean and standard deviation (as error bars) of $t_{exit}$ and $N_D$ as a function of $p_{immune}$.
