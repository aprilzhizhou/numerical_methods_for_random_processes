This program nvestigates the dependence of its dynamics on the recovery rate (or the death rate)
$r_{remove}$. 
For a system of size $L = 100,$ 
we use as initial condition a state in which only the individuals $(i = 50, j = 47:53)$ are infected (for $0 \leq r_{remove} \leq 1.5$ with $r_i = 0.5$ fixed) and plot snapshots of the resulting states..
